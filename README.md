# x16-mvclone
Metroid-vania Clone for Commander X16

This is a learning project for me to get familiar with the Commander X16 using assembly language.  I am using Visual Studio Code and Kick Assembler as my development environment.  I have the Kick Assembler extension for Visual Studio Code loaded also for syntax highlighting.  I will be developing custom tools for bitmap conversion as well.  The tools may be a separate projects in GitHub though as I would like them to be generic so I can use them in other projects.

I plan on using Tiled for my map editor.  There is a possibility I will also make a custom map editor as well.  That will depend on how good I get with the CX16 :).

The end goal is to have a complete game on an SD-Card image and for it to run on the real hardware when the hardware is released.
